# Email to EPUB

Move top n emails to a temp folder, extract to eml files (done via this project), then convert to epub (done via [this project, which also shares the same name with this project*](https://github.com/gonejack/email-to-epub)).

*Because I don't know how many different ways you can say "email to epub."

## Prerequisites

```bash
go install github.com/gonejack/email-to-epub@latest
```
